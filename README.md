Creating a sock puppet:
```
Good sock puppet has:
* to pretend to be a woman (it works good with man manipulation);
* to be "sociable" (to maintain social media accounts, have the friends, to invite the friend of friends, to like, to comment, to repost, etc.);
* to use one sock puppet for one mission.
